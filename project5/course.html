				Rwanda’s agriculture transformation agenda is based on the implementation of the national flagship agriculture strategy known as Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation (PSTA 4). The fiscal year 2020/21 marked the end of the third year of implementation of PSTA 4 and hence it is time to conduct a Mid-Term Evaluation to show the achievements and hurdles encountered in the road travelled so far. The Mid-Term Evaluation will provide greater insight on future implementation of the Strategy in order to ensure that our food system is able to cope with the effects of the COVID19 pandemic and remain resilient to future adverse events. The Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) will continue to promote the acceleration of agricultural growth, improvement of citizens’ livelihood, increased shared prosperity to farmers, and private sector investment opportunities in the agriculture sector through an array of tailored incentives.  Despite the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food systems, the agriculture sector has shown great resilience. In this fiscal year, more efforts were deployed to increase agriculture growth and its transformation from subsistence to commercial-led production. The involvement of youth and women in the sector have contributed significantly to modernization and value addition in different agricultural value chains. With the close of the fiscal year, Rwanda has also made progress in seeds supply self-sufficiency, including maize, soybean and wheat, and has been able to end all subsidies on imported seed. This is one among many other steps towards reaching our goals of national food self-sufficiency and the Zero Hunger SDG by 2030. PSTA 4 sets out ambitious targets to turn around the agriculture sector and transform it into a knowledge-based, value-creating sector that continues to contributes to the national economy and ensures food and nutrition security by 2024. To achieve this, the sector needs to develop new tools, new technologies, and new products with the potential to remove critical production constraints, and to forge new partnerships with regional and international stakeholders in the food systems to reach the goals of PSTA 4.  We have full confidence in the long-standing collaboration with our partners and stakeholders. The experience from past years assures us that there is solid resolve among our partners and deep engagement with our stakeholders that will help us move forward quickly and tackle key challenges on our farms, in our value chains, and throughout our food system, thereby unlock Rwanda’s full potential.  I continue to count on the continuous collaboration and support from all partners and stakeholders as we move forward together on this agriculture transformation journey.

				<h3>Development of a new technology to control Banana Xanthomonas Wilt </h3>
				<p>
					Xanthomonas wilt of banana (BXW) is a bacterial disease that seriously affects banana<p>W was officially reported in 2005 for the first time. BXW is reported to have caused reduced availability of banana in households and in markets in Rwanda and, thus, is a large threat to food security and income. There is no cure for BXW.</p> production. Yield losses of up to 100% have been reported in the East African region, including Rwanda. In Rwanda, BX Fortunately, through research, scientists in Banana program/RAB in collaboration with other international scientists have come up to an efficient technique for BXW control. This technique known as Single-diseased stem removal (SDSR).  
SDSR is a disease management practice to control BXW and recover banana production <p>rapidly. Instead of uprooting the whole sick banana mat, only the stem of a plant that is showing symptoms of BXW is cut at soil level. By continuously cutting only the diseased stem(s) of sick plants in a banana garden, the disease incidence within the garden drops rapidly. </p>Other stems and suckers on the banana mats, which supported the diseased stems, will often not get sick and will still be able

					Cassava production is constrained by biotic and abiotic stresses. Thus, its research and extension activities focused on development and dissemination of new varieties.<p>introduced for International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) (Table below). The variety release committee approved the release of 6 new varieties composed of Bulk 13 locally named Biseruka, Bulk 35 locally named Tegereza, Gahene/2, NAROCASS1 locally named Buryohe, NASE14 locally named Gikungu, and Ndamirabana/7.

				<h3>Training of Trainers on pineapple management and macro-propagation technique  </h3>	
     There is a great challenge in obtaining uniform planting materials in large quantity due to low rate of multiplication by conventional methods and lack of high-quality propagules. The need to solve this problem led to the development of pineapple macro-propagation technique in 2008 by RAB Horticulture program. A major advantage of the macro-propagation technique is that it does not require specialized skills. It is also very cost effective and can be <p>used to produce large scale uniform material in a relatively short period of time. Training of Trainers (ToTs) on pineapple macro-propagation technique and management were conducted in Nyamagabe and Gisagara districts, Southern Province of Rwanda. In addition, two cooperatives per sector were selected </p>

			<h2>Soybean Soybean </h2>lines at various generations were evaluated in Rubona station in seasons A & B. Main traits included: resistance/ tolerance to pests and diseases, maturity, logging, shattering yield and seed quality traits <p>such as protein and oil. In addition to the segregating lines under evaluation in Rubona station, in season 2021 A, 5 stable lines (S4243; S3301; S0107; S3348 and S3303) have been selected and advanced for yield performance evaluation in Rubona, Ngoma, Gashora and Nyagatare RAB stations. This trial was repeated in season 2021B to</p> confirm their stability and adaptability before taking them to further evaluations.  
In season 2021A, 20 entries of new soybean accessions were introduced in the framework of partnership with the soybean innovation Lab at Illinois University/USA. Those accessions were tested in four RAB <p>stations: Rubona, Gashora, Ngoma and Nyagatare. The trial was repeated in season 2021B with other local varieties to confirm their stability and adaptability in tropical environments of Rwanda. The best performing lines will be advanced for further testing in onfarm trials in season 2022A.  </p>

					The Crop Protection program focuses on management of major insect, pests and diseases affecting priority crops in the country. These are among the major constraints limiting agricultural productivity, farmers’ income and livelihoods. There is unprecedented pest pressure due to the effects of climate change. During the fiscal year 2020/21, the crop protection’s activities were the following:  
					<br>Characterization of anthracnose races in major common bean growing zones  Consider a real life example of a man driving</br>
					Samples were collected in the northern and eastern agricultural zones of Rwanda, in the main anthracnose hotspot areas. Through this study, 150 anthracnose isolates were identified, and a single spore culture for further anthracnose isolates characterization is on-going.

					In FY 2020/21, a total of 71,883 MT of coffee cherries was processed through 313 Coffee Washing Stations (CWS). Coffee export quantities and revenues have been fluctuating over the past years. Compared to last fiscal year, there was a decrease in exported quantities but revenues increased by 1.8% mainly due to increased average prices from $3 per/kg to $3.6 per/kg. The main exported coffee types were fully washed coffee (77.85%), Semi washed (10.7%), Triage (5.08%) and Natural (4.24%).
